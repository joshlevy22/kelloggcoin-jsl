# Cryptocurrency is all the rage. You have decided to create your own,
# KelloggCoin, that will massively disrupt financial markets at the Global
# Hub.

# Don't change the following code, which represents a series of transactions, each
# of which represents a transfer of KelloggCoin from one user to another â€“ transactions 
# with no from_user are from the "ICO" (Initial Coin Offering)

  { "from_user" => nil, "to_user" => "ben", "amount" => 20000 },
  { "from_user" => nil, "to_user" => "brian", "amount" => 20000 },
  { "from_user" => "ben", "to_user" => "evan", "amount" => 9000 },
  { "from_user" => "brian", "to_user" => "anthony", "amount" => 7000 },
  { "from_user" => "evan", "to_user" => "anthony", "amount" => 400 },
  { "from_user" => "ben", "to_user" => "anthony", "amount" => 1500 },

  { "from_user" => "anthony", "to_user" => "evan", "amount" => 1750 }

# Write code below that returns the number of KelloggCoin that each user has in their 
# KelloggCoin "wallet".

# It should print out:
# Ben's KelloggCoin balance is 14000
# Brian's KelloggCoin balance is 13000
# Evan's KelloggCoin balance is 10350
# Anthony's KelloggCoin balance is 2650
